Extended from one of the Jitter examples, this patch maps images from a webcam onto a sphere. As someone moves in front of the webcam waves ripple across the sphere. It was originally created for the 2nd part of Scene 7 (Flow) from Water in the Desert, where dancers' movements created the waves. I'm using an Auvi object (au.lunarize) to color the video, which doesn't work with Max 6. Just replace that with your own effect and it will work fine. Otherwise use Max 5 and download Auvi - http://www.auvi-software.com/.
